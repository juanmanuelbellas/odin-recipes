    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <h4>For the chicken:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the chicken breasts of any fat and tendons.</li>
        <li>
            Cut the chicken breasts into thin slices of about 5cm of lenght and 0.5mm of 
            thickness.
            <br>
            <em>
                Make sure to cut against the muscle fibers for a tender bite.
            </em>
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt and leave on a drying rack or a plate with a paper towel to drain
            out any excess water. 
            <br>
            This will help to get a better sear. Leave for 10 minutes while you prep the 
            vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>Dry the excess water from the chicken with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken with a Tsp of smoked paprika.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan over high heat. Once heated add any vegetable oil of your liking.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken in batches. First on one side and then flipping onto the other.
            <br>
            <em>
                Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, this will cause the temperature of the 
                pan to drop significantly and any water remaining in the chicken won't be 
                able to evaporate quickly enough for you to get a good sear, you will be 
                boiling it instead.
            </em>    
        </li>
        <li>Once cooked set aside and move to the next batch until you have cooked all of it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely dice the onion. The finer the better.</li>
        <li>Slice the mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Reheat the pan used for the chicken to medium heat and add oil.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and season with salt to drain the water out of them.</li>
        <li>Once the water from the mushrooms has evaporated get a good sear on them 
            and add the finely diced onions, season again with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>While the onions are cooking boil 250ml of water and dissolve the chicken stock 
            cube into it.
        </li>
        <li>Cook until the onions have softened and browned a little.</li>
        <li>Add 100ml of white wine and stir to dissolve any fond built up in the pan. 
            Cook the wine until all the alcohol has evaporated.
        </li>
        <li>Add 2Tbsp of flour, mix well and cook the flour for 2 minutes stirring occasionally.
            <br>
            <em>This helps thicken the sauce.</em>
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock and stir well to dissolve the flour. Make sure there aren't any
            lumps. Let it cook until the stock is reduced in half.
        </li>
        <li>Add 250ml of heavy cream, 1/3 cup of milk and the cooked chicken with all 
            of the juices that might have leaked out and heat up. Be careful not to boil it.
            <br>
            <em>If the sauce is not thick enough you can dissolve some cornstarch on milk and 
                add it at this point, cook it for a minute or two and it will thicken it up.
                <br>
                You can adjust the amount of flour in the future to avoid using cornstarch.
            </em>
        </li>
        <li>Serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the rice:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up a pot to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add a Tbsp of oil and leave to heat up.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of white rice and saut√© it until you see a transparent layer around 
            the rice.
        </li>
        <li>Add 4 cups of room temperature water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling lower the heat and cover the pot with a lid.</li>
        <li>Once the water has been fully incorporated remove the lid and fluff with a 
            wooden spoon.</li>
    </ol>
